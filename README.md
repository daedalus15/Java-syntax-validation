# Validating Language Constructs in Java using PLY Tools in Python

---

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Automata Formal Languages & Logic** course for the 3rd semester. The goal is to validate Java language constructs using **PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)** which is used to assess the syntactical correctness of Java code snippets.

---

## 📝 Key Features
- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizing Java constructs using PLY's lexer.  
- **Syntax Parsing**: Checking the structure of Java constructs with PLY's parser.  
- **Error Reporting**: Highlighting errors in syntax or tokenization.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the validator.  
- **PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)**: A library used for lexing and parsing.  
- **Java**: Target language for validation.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Lexical Analysis**:  
   - The lexer breaks the Java code into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.  

2. **Syntax Parsing**:  
   - The parser uses a context-free grammar to validate the order and structure of tokens.  

3. **Validation Output**:  
   - The program outputs whether the Java construct is valid or invalid, along with error messages if applicable.
